         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I do not mean thereby, that all that are called and reputed <hi>Quakers,</hi> are no Chriſtians; for my charity is large enough to believe, That many of them would abhorr the Principles of their Leaders, did they but well underſtand them: for whoſe ſakes in part I have undertaken this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108796:13"/> But they have another opinion of it, or they would not call it blaſphemy to be otherwiſe minded; and we ſhall finde it ere I have done, to be their forelorn Hope; by which they attempt to make a breach on the Authority and eſteem the Scripture hath juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the hearts of all ſerious Chriſtians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with more eaſe and ſecurity to enter the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and groſs of their deluſions; and therefore I ſhall encounter it firſt and in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary before I proceed, to let you <label type="milestone">

Theſe things are too high for them.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, we dare not call them a dead letter, (who have felt them <hi>ſharper then any two-edged</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> written or printed, we call the Word of God; ſo far as the print or writing agrees (in its kind) with the Original Copies; which were written by, or by the Direction of God himſelf, his ſon or ſervants inſpired by him, ſo we call it the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but with this diſtinction, <hi>the written Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the Scriptures are the <hi>Word</hi> of God in the <label type="milestone">

                  <p n="1">1. That it is improper ſo to call them, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> of God.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That this Title is <hi>peculiar</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they deny them to be the Word of God in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number. I muſt therefore in dealing with this great Criticiſm, reconcile the <hi>plural</hi> number to the ſingular.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, to the firſt, it ſounds methinks very harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> that not <hi>one word</hi> in the Scriptures ſhould be the Word of God, becauſe there are in them more words then one. Surely, if the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, and ſo on, be the Word of God, then every word in it is the Word of God: and never the leſs, but rather the more for being united; for that there are few ſingle words, which ſtanding alone will ſignifie any thing, whereas divers put together, have a ſenſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the whole body of the Scripture conſidered together, doth ſignifie the mind of God more compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then if it were diſmembred and conſidered apart.</p>
                  <p>But I know they aim at more then a meer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108796:14"/> 
                     <hi>Grammar</hi>-nicety, at which kind of failings they uſe not <hi>much</hi> to quarrel; but are rather affected with them, as if the Spirit of God delighted in real non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; though I think the cauſes to be three eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Firſt, that their firſt Authors could ſpeak or write no better; and they take it to be a perfection to write falſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> and nonſenſe after ſuch infallible perſons. Secondly, becauſe they have ſo few of thoſe they call their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> able to write true ſenſe and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that thoſe who can if they liſt will not, leſt they ſhould diſgrace their Brethren; and rather then <hi>that</hi> ſhould be admitted, it ſhall become the faſhion, and obtain in time to be better <hi>Engliſh</hi> then ſenſe. A third reaſon may be, their taking all, matter and form, to be <hi>infallibly</hi> from the Spirit, and therefore dare not amend the ſenſe of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>

So I ſay of the Word that was God, it was the Word that was in the beginning, that created all things. Shew me any ſuch Word and I will call it God too: yea, I will ſay it is blaſphemy to deny it to be ſo.

Chriſt is called the Way, the Truth and the Life; but if you ſhould make every ſuch expreſſion to be meant of Chriſt and God; I am ſure we ſhould have Lords many, and Gods many, in a far lower ſenſe then the Magiſtrates, and great men of the world; and Chriſt would be little beholden to us. I beſeech you therefore, who are not ſtark blind, and ſteel-hard; either to abandon ſuch principles, or at leaſt do not pretend to Scripture for them, and abuſe it after this manner; for the Scriptures are no friend

                  <p>That where any phraſe or word may be taken in a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> proper ſenſe, it ought ſo to be taken: unleſs there be a neceſſity to do otherwiſe, from the conſideration of the Context. As in the point in hand, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Word was God, in the beginning,</hi> here it cannot be underſtood of the Word in a proper and ordinary acceptation; becauſe ſuch words or word cannot be God, neither were in the beginning. Beſides, what is afterwards ſpoken of the Word there is plainly and onely to be underſtood of Chriſt the Son of God, but if you conſider the Word expreſſed, <hi>Mark 4. 19.

                  <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you what is a word in a proper <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> ſenſe, and that the Scriptures are ſuch: and what in a figurative ſenſe, and that Chriſt or the Son of God (as the Word in <hi>ordinary</hi> acceptation) is ſuch.</p>
                  <p>A word in a proper ſenſe, is either an articulate ſyllabical ſound, which the eare is receptive of, and by which ſomewhat may be underſtood as its ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a commonly received acceptation.</p>
                  <p>Or alſe a writing, impreſſion or graving, which is ſuch a diſpoſing of letters in their Order as doth expreſs and ſignifie to the eye, what the other doth to the ear.</p>

                  <p>A figurative word, or word in a figurative conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Firſt, they will allow them to be <hi>of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So they affirm their own Writings and Sayings to<note place="margin">Morning Watch. 52.</note> be alſo <hi>of God; (And let not this ſeem ſmall in your eyes,—ye ſhall you all one day know that the Lord hath ſpoken it</hi>) not only in ſome ſenſe, but in a <hi>higher</hi> then the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, at leaſt with reſpect to them, and the times wherein we live.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the Scriptures of truth.</hi>

                  <p>This is ground enough for us to deal with them by the Authority of the Scriptures; but there are many other Writings that are true; and if you take the Scriptures to be underſtood by way of Eminency, the <hi>Scriptures of truth;</hi> ſo as <hi>no</hi> other Writings extant are ſo <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>divinely</hi> true, they will utterly diſclaim ſuch a ſenſe.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108796:20"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are the Experiences of the Saints, and</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>what they witneſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is with them a very common phraſe. Though<note place="margin">A true Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of what the Saints were made wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of. <hi>Smith Prim.</hi> p. 10.</note> this be true of ſome part of the Scriptures, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi>) it is too narrow a title by far for the whole Body of the Scriptures. And for that part of the Scriptures, which expreſſes the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences</hi> of the Saints, it hath ſomewhat more as its end then a meer <hi>witneſſing,</hi> or expreſſing how it was with them. But I do not wonder that they ſo much delight in this phraſe, when I conſider that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſtrain almoſt all the Concerns of Religion to their <hi>Experiences;</hi> yea, things <hi>Hiſtorically</hi> related, that were done <hi>without</hi> them long ago, and are never again to be acted on the ſtage of this world: and things <hi>Prophetically</hi> related in the Scriptures, which ſhall not have a being until the end of the world. They experience the Birth, Righteouſneſs, Sufferings, Death, Burial Reſurrection, Alcenſion and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt. They experience the downfall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Day of Judgment, Heaven, Hell, and all within them: and not with reſpect to ſome effects, impreſſions and ſimilitudes of theſe things: but really, and almoſt (if not altogether) excluſively of any other meaning: all of which you will find proved in the following Diſcourſe. But this is far ſhort and wide of owning the Scriptures to be the Word of God. There are no Saints but have their Experiences, both good and bad; but he that ſhould write them, and affirm them to be the Word of God, as they are the Experiences of the Saints, will fall with<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18. 19. &amp; Deut. 4. 2.</note> a witneſs under that ſevere cenſure of that true and legitimate Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>They call them a Declaration of the Mind</hi>

                     <hi>of God.</hi> This (all things conſidered) is the higheſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108796:20"/> expreſſion of their eſteem of the Holy Scriptures and Word of God; (for ſo I will call them whether they will or no) but ſo were ſome part of the Writings of the Heathen-Idolaters, who knew not the true God. Yea, many things which they ſpake of, as the Duty of Man, and againſt many immoral Vices. The Apoſtle ſayes no leſs, when he quotes ſuch Paſſages out of ſuch Heathen-Authors, <hi>Evil communications</hi>

And ſome ſuch things they have not only dictated for the matter, but have alſo preſſed them as the mind of God, according to thoſe notions they had of him. And much more may the large and precious Sermons and Writings of the Servants and Miniſters of Chriſt (whoſe Diſcourſes are grounded on the Holy Scriptures;) yet he that ſhould call them the Word of God in a ſtrict ſenſe, deſerves cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. A man may declare his mind, (yea, or ſome things of the mind of God) by geſtures, nods, becks, frowns, ſmiles, yet they are not to be equalled by the expreſſion of his mind by his Word, they being much more imperfect and unintelligible then words; the holy converſations of the ſound and godly do eminently and effectually declare the mind of God; yet had we them in its ſtead we ſhould be great loſers.</p>
                  <p>Not only the Writings and Sayings of intelligent <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> creatures, but alſo the inanimate part of the Creation is a Declaration of God, and of his mind alſo in many things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, 2.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108796:21"/> will ſay, that the Declaration made by them is of equal value with the Word of God, either for matter, ſtile, manner, or perſpicuity?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>They are a Declaration of the Word of God.</hi>

                  <p>To clench the Nail I have been driving hitherto, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>VII</label> I muſt demonſtrate, that to deny the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, is to <hi>deny</hi> the Scriptures, which I ſhall do three ways in few words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is to deny them that title by which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, and diſtinguiſhed from, and lifted up above all other Writings whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I will ask any man who underſtands ſenſe, and hath but one grain of reaſon; if to deny the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to be the King of <hi>England,</hi> were not to deny the King? though he that doth ſo ſhould allow him to be entituled a Man, a Gentleman, yea, a Nobleman or Duke, which are titles common
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108796:21"/> to him with others, or below him? ſure I am, we Chriſtians are elſe under an old muſty miſtake, and guilty of great ſlander, for affirming the <hi>Turks</hi> to deny Chriſt, becauſe they will not own him to be greater then their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of mens ſouls, while they own him to be not only a Man, but alſo a great Prophet, and next to <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf. I ſuppoſe, a <hi>Quaker,</hi> whoſe Child ſhould own him to be a Man, and a good man too, and one that provides well for him, and yet ſay, He is not his Father, and ſtand to it in earneſt, would ſay that Son denies him, and is a naughty wicked Child.

                  <p>To deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> is to deny <hi>that Appellation</hi> on which their <hi>Authority</hi> is grounded, and which puts an <hi>awe</hi> upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men.

The Papiſts, who are the more ſubtil, will tell us, that in their <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> they terminate their worſhip in God alone, but alas, the common people are for downright language; and they, poor ſouls, being exhorted to worſhip the <hi>Images,</hi> do it devoutly, and <hi>think no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed ſo many are the excellent Characters given to the Scriptures under that notion, that if they wear them and ſhine in their luſtre, the Quakers Glow-worm muſt ſparkle no-where but in the dark, and may ſtill keep its Court and Confines in the Heathen-world.</p>

And I ſhall begin with their Infallibility; I am confident that <hi>G. Fox</hi> the Ring-leader of the Sect: underſtands not what he ſaith, nor whereof he affirms. It is one thing not to fail, another to be infallible; for that is to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all poſſibility of falling or erring. Again, it is one thing to be infallible, with a reſtriction to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, another to be univerſally infallible, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>G. Fox</hi> underſtands ſo much, he is a Non-ſuch <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> for confidence, and being void of reaſon, that affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as he doth; let us examine but that one paſſage before-cited, <hi>How can ye be Miniſters of the Spirit and not of the Letter, if ye be not infallible?</hi> Here he puts Miniſtry of the Spirit, and of the Letter, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles joyned hand in hand, as loving companions and meet helps each to other. <hi>And there was delivered unto him the Book of</hi>

                     <hi>the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>and when he had opened the Book, he found the place where it was written, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 21. <hi>And he began to ſay unto them, this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears, and all bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words, &amp;c.</hi> was not Chriſt then a Miniſter of the Spirit? it is by him ſaid, this day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears, <hi>viz. the Spirit of the Lord is upon me;</hi> And was he not alſo a Miniſter of the Letter? why <hi>he opened the Book, and found where it was written;</hi> and no doubt read it out of the Book to his Auditors; or elſe it would have been very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to tell them, <hi>This Scripture is fulfilled,</hi> for they muſt have divined, or not known what Scripture he intended. And I ſuppoſe none will doubt whether that which is written in a Book be written in Letters. Well then, either <hi>George Fox</hi> is fallible, yea, and hath groſly failed, or Jeſus Chriſt was not a Miniſter of the Spirit; and which of theſe you who call your ſelves infallible Miniſters of the Spirit will admit of, I know not: but I am ſure every true Chriſtian will abhor a Competition between Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>G. Fox.</hi> And what the Lord and Maſter did in this caſe, ſo did his ſervants the Apoſtles, as I might inſtance abundantly. I will direct you only to <hi>Peters</hi> Sermons, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. I need not inſtance in any more. He that hath read the Scriptures may eaſily furniſh himſelf. And who can doubt but they who made uſe of the Letter of the Scriptures, for evidence of what in their Miniſtry they preached or writ; were Miniſters of the Letter as well as of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, if we conſider the letter of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> Scripture to be the letter of the Spirit, written by its direction, and to expreſs (in its kind) the mind of the Spirit, This Querie of <hi>George Fox</hi> may be turned upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108796:27"/> himſelf thus; and how can ye be Miniſters of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if ye be not Miniſters of the Letter alſo?</p>
                  <p>The latter part of his Sentence is a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> of the fallibility of his Chair; <hi>And how can they but delude people who are not infallible?</hi> True indeed, if they did perſwade people, that they could not in any thing be miſtaken, or be ignorant: but ſeeing only the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended Miniſtry, and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> do aſſume this to themſelves; they only are in a neceſſity of deluding the people; for our parts, who live in all manner of pride, (as the Quakers by their ſpirit of Infallibility do charge us) we are not yet come up to their Perfection, for we freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we may erre in Doctrine, and do erre in Practice, which we bewail before God and men; and alſo that the people may not be deluded by us, we deſire them, and charge them not to pin their Faith on our ſleeves; but repair to the Law and to the Teſtimony, and ſearch the Scriptures, try whether the things we affirm be ſo or no: And if we ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Mind of God there expreſſed, to reject our Doctrine; and alſo that they <hi>follow our Example</hi> no further then we follow Chriſt, even that <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> who was for a time on Earth, but is now in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But what do you think of the Holy Apoſtles? were <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> they univerſally infallible? could not they erre? if you ſay ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> will convict you of errour, in his charging <hi>Peter,</hi> (none of the leaſt of the Apoſtles) with erring, and in ſomething deluding the people, <hi>Gal. 2. 12, 13, 14. Peter</hi> diſſembled the truth in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing the Moſaical diſtinction of Jews and Gentiles, and ſeparating from the believing Gentiles as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: <hi>And the other Jews,</hi> (yea, <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>alſo) was carried away with his diſſimulation.</hi> But then you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108796:27"/> will ſay, how can we be ſure that what they wrote and taught was truth?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that although they might in ſome things be carried away by temptation (as <hi>Peter</hi> was in that caſe) yet their doctrine, which they profeſſed to be from the Lord, and by the Inſpiration of God, could not admit of erring or fallibility: and that not becauſe they had an habitual infallibility in all things; but becauſe of the love of God to his people, the regard of his honour, and the firmneſs of his Promiſes which he made to them: thoſe eſpecially <hi>John 14. 26. But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>Howbeit, when he the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall hear that ſhall he ſpeak; and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Now theſe Promiſes being made to the Apoſtles for furniſhing them with ability for their work, as Apoſtles, they may be concluded to be infallibly guided by the Spirit; but in other things, though by their eminent habitual grace they were not likely to fail as others, who were not cloathed with ſuch a meaſure and degree as they: yet it was more then poſſible that they ſhould fail, but according to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s infallibility, and without limitation, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves could not but delude the People.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this particular of Infallibility, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> take, beſide what hath been ſaid, one conſiderable proof of their non-attainment of Infallibility, and that is the moſt groſly abſurd Expoſition they give of the Scriptures.

                  <p>I will conclude this Chapter with ſome Inferences <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>V</label> and Concluſions that naturally flow from this errour, (for one errour never goes alone) <hi>viz.</hi> That their writings and ſayings are equal with the Scriptures, and to be preferred before them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it would follow that the Scriptures both are <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> and ever were ſuperfluous; for the light within (as they pretend) was alway fitted to inſpire every man and woman in the ſame manner, and to all intents and purpoſes, as they were inſpired and written.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon the ſame ground the tenets and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> aſſertions of all the Heathen, are to be received as of equal Authority with the Scriptures; for although they did not pretend them for divine Inſpirations or Revelations, yet they reſulted from their light within, improved much more orderly and to purpoſe then the <hi>Quakers</hi> do theirs, (whoſe ungrounded Pretenſions to Inſpirations weigh nothing in the caſe) yea, the bitter ſcoffs of <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate muſt be admitted into the ſame Orders, for, if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted they did not vilifie and ſcorn, and deride Chriſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108796:29"/> the Scripture, and Chriſtianity, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their Conſciences; it cannot be denyed, that they therein acted from the power within, which whether it were the power of darkneſs or not, the <hi>Quakers</hi> having no rule to judge it by but their own ſentiments, it is left by them undetermined: And I know not hardly any worſe they ſaid of Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> the Scripture, and Chriſtianity; then the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have done under other Names.</p>

Who is a lier, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt; he is Antichriſt that denieth the Father and the Son.</hi> That you who are called <hi>Quakers</hi> deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt. I prove at large in a Chapter by its ſelf: that you deny the Father and the Son, is no leſs, true of you, who will admit no diſtinction between the Father and the Son: ſo that the Father is (with you) as much the Son of the Father, as the Son is the Son of the Father: and the Son is as much the Father (with you) of the Son, as the Father is the Father of the Son, that by diſtroying theſe diſtinctions you deſtroy the relation of Father and Son in the Godhead, which the Scripture ſpeaks of ſo plainly: and it is hereby apparent, that your quarrel is not ſo much with the word Trinity, as with the thing thereby expreſſed.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108796:34"/> The next black mark of Antichriſt which is upon you, is that in 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 4. who oppoſeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped: ſo that he</hi> as God <hi>ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that</hi> he <hi>is</hi> God. Do not you advance your light within above the Man Chriſt Jeſus, whom we worſhip as God, and who is ſo called in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: even that Man, whoſe being is above the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heavens? Do not you call your light within you God eternal, Omnipotent, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Yea, you ſay it is the light in the Conſcience, (which is the Temple of God) and there it doth (as if it were God) rule, govern, judge, execute, in contempt of the written and true Laws of the divine being. I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, and lay them to your hearts.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Holy Scriptures do (in their kind) determine or diſcover to us, whether we believe and walk, or practiſe aright or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe I ſhall prove from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>all that the Prophets have ſpoken, &amp;c.</hi> If it had not been their duty to believe according to the ſayings of the Lord by the Prophets, (which were not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate to the Diſciples) it had been neither their fault nor their folly not to believe, or to have been ſo ſlow and unready to believe, even thoſe Propheſies which foretold the death and ill handling of the Meſſias; which was ſo much above their underſtandings, and ſo thwart to their affections. Yea the innocent and compaſſionate Jeſus would have been not a little faulty, for ſo ſeverely rebuking them for what was no crime at all.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:108796:37"/>
                  <p>But leſt you ſhould ſay, theſe Prophecies were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; (as ſome of you have ſaid) know firſt, that they were ignorant of them, <hi>for as yet they</hi>

                     <hi>hath commanded you; you ſhall not turn aſide to the right hand or to the left.</hi> If it be objected, this was obliging to <hi>them,</hi> not to <hi>us;</hi> who are not under <hi>Moſes's</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. I anſwer, firſt, that the commands here chiefly intended, were ſuch as oblige all men in all Ages, for the matter of them, which is alway juſt and righteous. Secondly, the ground of their authority being the Lord commanding, reaches to whatever he commands in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had them not immediately by inſpiration, but by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> either from his mouth to that Generation, or by Writing and Tradition to the Generations following. <hi>Who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>for</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the holy Scriptures determine according <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> to their kind, or as much as a Writing can do, whether we believe and practiſe aright or not.

It is a bleſſed thing to have this Word hid in the heart as <hi>David</hi> practiſed, and as God commands: but if by the Scripture they mean the dead Letter, Ink, and Paper (as they call them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they liſt) they would be but a bad and troubleſom Inmate.</p>
                  <p>I do acknowledge with all my ſoul, that to have <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> the Scriptures within in the ſenſe of them, yea and the words too, is an ineſtimable bleſſing; ſuch a one as young <hi>Timothy,</hi> and eloquent <hi>Apollos</hi> were crowned with: and few of the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are who have not the Scripture within in ſome good meaſure; but alas! memory is ſo weak and frail it will not hold all: and ſo confuſed ever and anon, that it is neceſſary to go to the Scripture <hi>without</hi> not only to get in more, but alſo to repair decayed and broken notions of them, and to be ſure that our <hi>crazy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> by brooding upon the frame of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, have not hatched ſomething of its own, and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted</hi> it Scripture: which the Quakers are not a little guilty in.</p>
                  <p>But while I am commending the firſt part of their <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Tenet, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture is within; ſuppoſing it taken in as good a ſenſe as it may be; I muſt not forget the latter part which hath the dregs and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>viz. and was read within before it was read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> If by reading it within before without, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it only of the Penmen of the Scriptures, I would join with them, and ſay ſo too: but they intend nothing leſs; but, that in the light which every man hath <hi>within</hi> him, there is the Scripture all and every part, (at leaſt that may be of uſe) if it had never been without. I would willingly be reſolved of a few things by thoſe that are of this mind. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the gracious God expoſe the Prophets and Apoſtles to ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108796:43"/> many difficulties, dangers, and deaths for declaring the matters contained in the Scriptures, if they were read, and might be read by all men within? Why did God with his own finger write the Ten words or Commands, and cauſe other of his Servants to write both them and the other parts of the Scripture? Why doth he command to read the Scriptures, and by reading and ſtudying them to get them into the heart, memory, underſtanding? <hi>And it ſhall be with</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God; to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſtatutes to do them.</hi> It was not to be with him as you commonly phraſe it [in him] their is no ſuch <hi>it</hi> in the Text, but the Relative it, hath for its Antecedent in the Verſe next before, <hi>he ſhall write him a Copy of this</hi> Law <hi>in a</hi> Book <hi>out of that which is before the Prieſts, the Levites:</hi> it <hi>ſhall be with him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why did Chriſt himſelf read out of the Book if it were within them? Why did not God chide <hi>Joſiah</hi> for not doing according to the Law (as being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wilful neglect) before he found it in the Book? why did God commend and reward his tenderneſs of heart in fearing, when the Law was read out of the Book, if he were ſo hard-hearted as not to hear the Law within? Why did Jeſus Chriſt never rebuke the Jews for not heeding the Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while he oft rebuked them for not heeding and believing the Scripture without? theſe are enough and to ſpare, to diſcover the vanity of this conceit. The truth is, the Scriptures were written (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us) firſt without, then within.</p>
                  <p>I would gladly hear any of the Quakers make <label type="milestone">

For the Law was given by Moſes.</hi> And the Scriptures were<note place="margin">John 1. 17.</note> given firſt immediately from God, and that is their authority with us, though they are handed to us through many Generations, as the Books of the Law

                  <p>And moreover it were a very ſuperfluous thing for <label type="milestone">

The like may be ſaid of the New Teſtament Commands and Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Theſ. 2. 15. Therefore Brethren ſtand faſt, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or Epiſtle.</hi> Did you ever hear of an Epiſtle come immediately from God? and all the Doctrines of the Goſpel were conveyed to others, except the Penmen or Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, by Epiſtles; or what is of the ſame import in this matter.</p>

                  <p>I conclude this Chapter with ſome conſequences of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>III</label> the denying the doctrines, commands, holy examples in the Scripture contained, to be binding to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they come to us by immediate inſpiration or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then all miniſtry by men is ſuperfluous and vain; and that not only our miniſtry, but that alſo which you call yours, who affirm this dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
                  <p>Can you ſay your Miniſters are the Spirit? if the Spirit teach by, or through them, it teaches mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but I ſay not this as if I took it to be of bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that your Miniſtry ſhould ceaſe: but to ſhew
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108796:48"/> you how greatly contradictory you are to your own principle. You ſay the light and the anointing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, is a ſufficient, and only Teacher; and no other can oblige, or move you: yet none make a greater noiſe in that you call teaching, or declaring, or are ſo troubleſome and importunate therein as your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conſequence will be, that however the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> Scriptures are a Monitor from which we may ſtore our ſelves with Gods counſel, and commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in the intervals, and mean whiles between inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and motions from the Spirit within: we have no obligation to any duty, nor can we commit any ſin. For where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion; take away the Scripture Precepts, and to you there is none, but as inſpirations drop in: and then I aſſure you, (for all your pretences) you may live lawleſly enough: inſpirations being now ſo rare; and when they were more plentiful, but one <hi>Balaam</hi> among the wicked was ſo viſited, as we read of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then the Scriptures ſignifie juſt nothing, but a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> Romance to read, to exerciſe the fancy; or at moſt but as a prophane or common Hiſtory, from which we learn nothing but what others did and ſaid; and how it was with them. If you read the Scripture commands, they are nothing to you; if you have a command <hi>in Spirit</hi> (as you call it) it is enough: though it never were in the Scriptures; yea, though it be contrary to the Scripture, reaſon, and all modeſty.</p>

                  <p>THis is a bold and ſtrange aſſertion, from thoſe <label type="milestone">

If the Scriptures are thus impotent, I know no uſe they are of in things of a Religious concern; all Religions aiming at and depending upon the knowledge of God and our ſelves: and the Chriſtian Religion as ſuch, on the knowledge of Chriſt. They may, notwithſtanding this affirmation, call them Scriptures, <hi>i. e.</hi> Writings ſtill; but ſure they do but mock them in calling them <hi>holy</hi> Scriptures, or they are greatly ignorant what the word <hi>holy</hi> imports.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108796:49"/> there is no coming to the knowledge of God but by Chriſt; for ſome knowledge of God may be attained not only without Chriſt as the means, but without the Scripture alſo.</p>
                  <p>So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, (whom we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <label type="milestone">

If he had ſaid, no other way to know God ſavingly without Chriſt, he had ſaved his credit here, and hit the mark: but what will not men ſay that have a mind the Scripture ſhould be ſilent? The reaſon he grounds this upon is of like ſtrength to moſt, which they produce under that name or form: <hi>For Chriſt is the way;</hi> now this Scripture doth not ſpeak of the knowledge of God, but of coming to God; which is ſomewhat more than a bare knowledge of God; which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Suppoſe that over a great and deep River there <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> were but one Bridge; and he that would go to the other ſide muſt go by this Bridge: and it ſhould be ſaid (and truly) no man can get to the other ſide of the River, but by this Bridge: would this conclude that you muſt not enquire where this Bridge is? how you may paſs over by it? that you muſt not take thoſe paſſages, and ſteps that lead to the Bridge? that you muſt not have and uſe your leggs, and your eyes? and all becauſe you cannot get over but by the Bridge. At no wiſer a rate do the Quakers plead for Chriſt being the only way, excluding all other as ſubſervient. But enough of this paſſage: only obſerve, that the Author quoted will not have the Scriptures, nor any thing elſe (Chriſt excepted) to be any means of knowing God. Let us hear him explain himſelf a little more.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108796:50"/> miſtake and ſuppoſe that the light of Chriſt alſo is to be found in the Scripture. Hear him ſpeak plainer, and yet more to the purpoſe. <hi>Then he</hi> [John]<note place="margin">Morning Watch, p. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>declared him as he knew him; not from any tradition or writing before him: though then there was much written which did truly teſtifie of him.</hi> This he brings in to prove, that Chriſt is to be known and made known to others, not by the Scripture but his own light, or he himſelf the light within: and that though the Scriptures were then in being, he made no uſe of them to declare Chriſt by, to the knowledge of thoſe he preached to.</p>

                     <hi>of Hebrew, Greek, and Latine (which they call the Original) is nothing worth, as pertaining to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> This Author did certainly loſe the light, or the light loſe him, when he wrote this: I never heard the Latine called the Original of the Scripture Tranſlations before.

But however
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108796:50"/> we have been hitherto of this mind, the <hi>Quakers</hi> infallible monitor, the Light within (by which I am perſwaded he wrote this) will have it otherwiſe. I dare aſſure this learned perſon if he be alive, and can but prove the Latine to be the Original, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> will willingly give him a Cardinals Hat for his pains.</p>
                  <p>But this is not his original errour, though an errour concerning the Original. He ſaith the Original is nothing worth pertaining to the knowledg of God. If ſo, our Tranſlations which we had from thence are leſs worth than nothing: for they muſt give the upper hand to the Original.</p>

Truly friends you have here gone on Glaſs or Ice, which you will. You teach or declare in almoſt all your Writings, which concern teachings in a religious ſenſe, that you are taught immediately by the light within. Was ever any thing in this world ſhewn in a Glaſs immediately? that Glaſs may more congruouſly be called a Mirrour (the ancient name of a Loking-Glaſs) than any I ever ſaw or heard of: however let whatever be the Glaſs or means by which or in which we may ſee our faces, the Scriptures (by your leave) muſt not be it. But whether you will or no, the Scriptures are a Glaſs,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108796:51"/> or as a Glaſs, wherein if you or I will pleaſe to look with an honeſt mind, God will by it in a good meaſure ſhew us what we are: and they have one property above all the Looking-Glaſſes in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> that we can ſee your faces in and by them, though you ſhould not look into them, nor ſuffer the Book wherein they are contained to be in the ſame houſe where you are.</p>

By Goſpel Ordinances therefore, I do not intend either thoſe (with their circumſtances) that were known and practiſed by the light of nature; nor thoſe which were under the Moſaical adminiſtrations, with their circumſtances: but thoſe Ordinances which were commanded by precept, or preſcribed by example in the New Teſtament: or which being of natural obligation, are therein formed with the ſubſtantial and additional reſpect to a Mediator already come in the fleſh, and aſcended in his humane nature into heaven.</p>

                  <p>The true meaning of the Text is, that Jeſus Chriſt <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> by his death fulfilling what was ſignified by the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jewiſh Ordinances, and aboliſhing the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpenſation, entred his houſe [his Church] to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the adminiſtration of its affairs, which he in all things diſpoſed as was ſuitable to the gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Redeemer, and that glory of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that now ſhines in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. But will this great Prophet <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay, that the pure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Ordinances are againſt us? contrary to us? or as the Jewiſh, ſtanding in the way of the Converſion of the Gentiles through their burthenſomneſs? Will he ſay, that Chriſt by his death aboliſhed his own proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? Will he ſay, that he nailed them to his Croſs before they had a being, divers of them not being formed, till by his Apoſtles after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Will he ſay, that he blotted out the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and nailed that to his Croſs alſo, as ſoon as he had inſtituted it? as if he delighted in a fickle hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and to give life to an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and within twenty four hours put it to death: yea, to ingage his Diſciples thereby to remember his death as often as they did it, and yet aboliſh the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance by his death, and ſo take away all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of remembring his death thereby.</p>

You may hereby note what he denies, <hi>viz.</hi> outward forms, they are not to be touched; and his reaſon is an excellent one, the Saints have Chriſt in them. At another time he will ſay, <hi>Moſes, Abraham,</hi> and the Old-Teſtament Saints had Chriſt in them, and that in their own ſenſe; and yet, I hope, he will give us leave to believe, that it was their duty to obſerve Gods forms.

                  <p>Here is then the proof, that we ſpeak more than we know; and therefore lye.

                  <p>But the meaning of the Text may be (and I will truſt the ſober Readers judgment to decide it betwixt us) that they did not believe the Lord lived, and ſwearing what they thought untrue, or doubted of, they therein ſwear falſly, or that they dared to ſwear to a falſhood, and yet abuſe the Name and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God to confirm it. But I deſire thoſe who give credit to ſuch Teachers as infallible, and inſpired immediately from God, to try by the inſtance I am now upon, whether we are not likely to ſpeak more rightly concerning God from the Scripture, than their Teachers without book?

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> is a moſt palpable contradiction to their profeſſed Principle.

                  <p>But at a Meeting, not far from my dwelling, there <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> was the ſtrangeſt Teaching that, I believe, was ever heard of among pretended Reformers; and I had it from a man of note among them, who was one of the Meeting. <hi>There declared, not a man, but a woman,</hi> (that's ordinary) <hi>not an Engliſh woman, but a Dutch woman,</hi> (that is not ſo frequent) <hi>not in Engliſh, but in Dutch,</hi> this was orderly, according to the Popiſh Maſs, and prayers in an unknown tongue to the people. But the ſtrangeſt thing of all was, he told me, <hi>that although not one of them underſtood Dutch, nor could the Dutch woman interpret into Engliſh</hi> (at leaſt ſhe did not) <hi>they knew ſhe ſpake by the Spirit.</hi> I asked him how? He told me, <hi>becauſe they all found refreſhings.</hi> So have children many a time at Puppet-plays. What a paſs are theſe people come to, who yet deny all Teachings by man?</p>
                  <p>But that you may not doubt the truth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But what have they to ſay, think you, to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of their Principles in Teaching? Why, it is not they, but the Man Chriſt, or the Light, or the Spirit that teaches; and if ſuch light replies will not ſerve turn, you may go ſomewhere elſe to be ſatisfied for them. But beyond all contradiction, if the Churches, and Churches mentioned, and owned in

What the wiſdom is, intended by the Author, you ſhall ſee by and by: but the main formality inveighed againſt is keeping of ſet-times; but they may forgive us this errour, it being ſo well known, that <hi>they</hi> have ſet-times, and exceed their ordinary hours no more than we. And the wiſdom of the fleſh is, that we do it in our own wills. If they mean not in obedience to the will of God, 'tis more then they know: if it be according to the will of God, and our wills comply with that, it is ſo much the better, for God likes no ſervice againſt, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will. To chooſe the things that pleaſe God, pleaſes God very well. But that conceived prayer (as ſuch) ſhould be with iniquity, a myſtery of iniquity, and that to ſo high a degree, is a bold charge.

                  </p>
                  <p>That we ought to pray in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, is far from us to deny: but he that prayes according to the mind of the Spirit of God revealed in the Scripture, (which is the Spirits Directory) and who, by the commands, exhortations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes therein contained, is moved to pray: he prays in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, although he have no immediate motions from the Divine Being. He that obeys Gods commands in his written Word, doth his duty, and is through Chriſt accepted of him. But leaſt you ſhould miſtake the Quakers meaning of the phraſe, <hi>traditions of men,</hi> take notice, That they hold the written Word, and what is therein contained as its ſence, to be but the traditions of men, except it come to us by immediate inſpiration, as to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and not at ſecond hand; which I have already proved, and therefore need not do it over again.</p>
                  <p>By what I have here produced, you may learn, That <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> they deny any thing of man to be exerciſed in prayer. If he intend hereby, only the depravation that is come in ſince the fall, it were every right: but certainly faith in the Redeemer, and the promiſes which in him are yea and amen, the encouragement to prayer are come in ſince the fall though no part of the fall; and all the Ordinances of Chriſt, as ſuch, are come in ſince the fall; and faith and Goſpel-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are all in man moſt eminently. But that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, thinkings, and conceivings muſt be ſhut out alſo, is a moſt abſurd notion. What! muſt we pray, and neither conceive nor think what we are to do, what we ought to do, nor how to expreſs our ſelves? no, nor while we are praying? Muſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108796:79"/> all be done, as if man in his faculties of conceiving, knowing, were not Gods? nor to be concerned in his worſhip? Certainly, if nothing of man, ſoul or body, be active therein, man doth not worſhip God, nor pray at all, and ſo God worſhips himſelf; which is the true reſult of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Tenets.</p>
                  <p>But let us conſider a Text or two out of the Word <label type="milestone">

But to the Objection, take notice, that Water-Baptiſm is the ſign, the Baptiſm of the Spirit the main thing (but not all) ſignified: now to have the thing ſignifying, and the thing ſignified, called by the ſame name, doth not make them to be two of that name, no more than there were two new Covenants, becauſe the matter contained in the Covenant is called the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. And Circumciſion, the ſign of the Covenant, is called the Covenant alſo, <hi>Gen. 17. 13.

                  <p>A ſecond ground of this Doctrine of imputed<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 21: § 5.</note> righteouſneſs, is in <hi>Rom. 5. 21. That as ſin hath reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto death, even ſo might grace reign through right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> That this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and therein the abounding grace of God; is plain in the 17, 18, and 19 verſes, where the Apoſtle lays his argument for grace and righteouſneſs through Chriſt, in its ſimilitude to the influence of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin by imputation. <hi>For if by</hi> one <hi>mans offence death</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, A dogmatical or hiſtorical faith cannot juſtifie, or ſo act on the promiſe and Covenant, as to put us under the imputation of juſtifying righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for ſuch a faith the Devils have; and there is a vaſt difference between believing the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and believing in Chriſt.

                  <p>To the third Inſtance, which ſeems to joyn works<note place="margin">§ 13.</note> with faith in juſtification, that is, our works: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That although juſtifying faith is not without works, yet faith juſtifies without works: as a man cannot have ſeeing eyes, if he have not lungs, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108796:90"/> heart, and brains, which are eſſential to life, and the living motion of every member; yet the eye only ſees, and not the lungs, or brains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if you ſhould pluck the eyes out of the head, they would ſo alone be to little purpoſe. So works are eſſential to the being of juſtifying faith; yet faith alone is in the act of juſtitying, or ſo acts on Chriſt, as to juſtifie the perſon in the ſight of God, by cloathing the ſoul with Chriſts righteouſneſs. And although in the Text it is tranſlated, <hi>not by faith only,</hi> it may, and (I was going to ſay) ought to be tranſlated, <hi>alone;</hi> and then the ſenſe is but this. That faith which is alone without works doth not juſtifie a man in the ſight of God. And I ſhall give two good Reaſons for it: The one, becauſe it may be ſo without wrong to the Original. Secondly, It muſt be ſo, becauſe it will otherwiſe contradict the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the truth alſo, as expreſſed abundantly in other Scriptures.</p>

And the reaſon is clear, becauſe although Chriſt offered up himſelf by the Eternal Spirit, as both dignifying him to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs for ſuch a Sacrifice, and enabling him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it as a Lamb, for patience, innocency and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to overcome death: yet the mans nature of Chriſt, his ſoul and his body, was the only proper ſufferer and ſacrifice, for God cannot ſuffer, nor be put to death; and by the obedience and ſufferings thereof, was our reconciliation and redemption wrought. Only (as I ſaid before) its union hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical with the Divine Nature, did put it into ſuch a capacity, and entitle God, or the Divine Nature, (which in its fulneſs dwelt in him bodily) to all that he did and ſuffered.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle doth in theſe words allude to <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle gives the ſame anſwer to a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> ſuppoſed Objection, How ſhall we know what is our duty? How we ſhould pleaſe God, and be bleſſed therein? ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'Tis no ſuch difficult thing for you to know this; for what you have gotten into your heart out of this Book of the Law, and what you have in your mouth by diſcourſe and profeſſion, that is it you ſhould obſerve and do. So the Apoſtle, if you ſuppoſe while we preach ſalvation by Chriſt, whom you muſt receive, that we preach impoſſibilities, for that the perſon of Chriſt if in Heaven, or in the grave, he is out of your reach; this will cure your miſtake, to conſider; that as the Word of the Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught and wrote, was in the heart and mouth to do it, ſo the Word of faith, or to be believed, is in your heart and mouth to believe and confeſs it. And this will as effectually ſave you, as if Chriſt in his perſon were in your arms, yea and more too.

It ſorrily follows from hence, that it is in the hearts of all men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle agitating this argument farther <label type="milestone">

Verſe 15. <hi>Of them that are ſent,</hi> them whoſe feet are beautifull for the ſake of the glad tidings of the Goſpel of peace which they bring. And theſe are more than that one perſonal, or (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> phraſe it) eternal Word, Chriſt; for they are expreſſed by <hi>they, them,</hi> which are plurals; but Chriſt is but one.</p>
                  <p>Yet from this Text do they moſt confidently avouch Chriſt the Word who was in the beginning, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> and who is God, to be in the heart; and not only in the hearts of the Saints and Believers, but in theirs alſo, who are the moſt wicked and ignorant among the ſons of men.

                  <p>There is a paſſage of <hi>Willam Pen</hi>'s either in his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108796:108"/> Book called <hi>Sandy foundation, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe <hi>The Spirit of Truth, &amp;c.</hi> which is this, (at leaſt the matter of it) <hi>That Chriſt is moſt eminently the Word, all will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or none will deny.</hi> I have not time to look it: But I ſhall ſay thus much to antidote that fancy; That that is moſt eminently the Word of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, about which we contend, which is moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo; (though other conſiderations may render Chriſt the Word more eminent in another kind) and not that which is ſometimes, but improperly ſo called.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is called a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Door.</hi> 'Tis true, Chriſt as God is more eminent than all things beſide in Heaven and Earth; and we uſe to ſay, (and do not yet repent it) that all (uncompounded) good things are eminently in God. So, as there is ſtrength and courage in a Lion, with reſpect to ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Chriſt may be ſaid to be eminently, moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſtrong and couragious; but to be the moſt eminently a Lion, would be a ſtrange and untrue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Chriſt: For, <hi>Forma dat eſſe;</hi> and he that is without the form that gives the being, cannot be ſo eminently ſuch, as the meaneſt that hath the true form. And that the Word Chriſt is only ſo analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, I have ſhewed, and the definition of a Word, in the ſecond Chapter. I deſire Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> to conſider better next time, and not think every body elſe not a hairs breadth beyond his ſize.</p>
                  <p>A third Scripture I am willing to explain, to fence <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">SECT. </seg>VI</label> the weak againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeductions, is 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. We have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> This <hi>more ſure word of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108796:109"/> prophecy,</hi> compared with a voice from Heaven, which <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> heard, expreſſed in Verſe 17. is by <hi>Peter</hi> affirmed to be rather to be credited, than that, or any other immediate Revelation. By the <hi>more ſure word of prophecy,</hi> is meant thoſe prophecies written in the Old Teſtament, which are called, verſe 20. <hi>Prophecy of Scripture;</hi> and are called, <hi>The light that ſhineth in a dark place;</hi> as Prophecies ſhine, but with a dim light, (yet are welcom, and give ſome light) comparatively with Providences, which are the fulfilling of thoſe Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>dawning of the day,</hi> and the <hi>day-ſtar</hi> ariſing in their hearts, cannot be meant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> known and received by faith to ſalvation, and ſanctification too, in ſome meaſure: for ſo he was riſen in their hearts, when the Apoſtle wrote this; or elſe he would not have ſaid them to <hi>have obtained like precious faith</hi> with him, and others the Apoſtles and Saints, which he doth in verſe 1. as the direction of his Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>I therefore conclude, that the ſenſe is <hi>this,</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The grounds I have for this Expoſition are theſe, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108796:113"/> earthly <hi>Adam</hi> and nature; as I have already ſhewed out of their Authors: but therefore he is not to be believed in, which you have had proof of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>

But we preach Chriſt crucified. I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> The meaning therefore muſt be, That he and his fellow-Apoſtles did not preach the Goſpel for worldly reſpects, and eſteem of men; and pleaſe their fancies and humours, for the ſake of outward and carnal advantages. The grounds of this Expoſition are three among others.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From what is expreſſed in Verſe 17. as neceſſary to making the honour and intereſt of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our chief aim. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a

And as their ends, ſo the means is altered; for as before they ſhaped their whole courſe to pleaſe the fleſh, 'tis now conformed to pleaſing the Lord, and providing for their ſouls welfare.</p>

This is ſutable to the eighth Verſe of this Chapter, which hath ſome Contexture with Verſe 16. <hi>We are confident I ſay and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Then Chriſt was not in them as in his Heaven and Glory.</p>

                  <p>The proof of my Charge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will not depend upon ſuch nice and diſputable premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but if there be any ſuch thing as Idolatry in the whole world, I ſhall prove them guilty in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.

                  <p>My ſecond proof is in this Argument.</p>

                     <hi>All thoſe who worſhip that as God (profeſſedly, and according to their profeſſed principles) which is not God, are groſs Idolaters. But the</hi> Quakers <hi>do ſo:</hi> Therefore <hi>they are groſs Idolaters.</hi>

                  <p>My firſt <hi>Argument</hi> I ſhall firſt proſecute, and with that perſpicuity, as will be apparent to all that are not more blind than Bats. For the firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.

                  <p>And that which may put you out of doubt, that this is their Tenet, I can prove by many Witneſſes, that <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> one of their chief Miſleaders, (after much importunity to ſpeak his mind plainly in this matter) did affirm, <hi>That he did not believe

                  <p>For that in <hi>Job, if a Man die ſhall he live again?</hi> the meaning can be no more than this, (if <hi>Job</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood himſelf) he ſhall not live again in this world, and in that ſtate in which he liveth before death; which is plain from what he moſt confidently affirms, <hi>Job 19. 26, 27. And though after my skin Worms deſtroy</hi> this body, <hi>yet in my</hi> fleſh <hi>ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf and mine</hi> eyes <hi>ſhall behold and not another, though my Reins be conſumed within me.</hi> And it is remarkable, that <hi>God</hi> whom he here ſpeaks of ſeeing, is intended by him <hi>Chriſt the Redeemer</hi> who ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the <hi>Earth</hi> verſe 25: for that in <hi>Fccleſiaſtes 3. 19. As the one dieth ſo dieth the other.</hi> It is expounded in the next verſe, <hi>all go unto one place, all are of the</hi> duſt, <hi>and all turn to</hi> duſt <hi>again.</hi> But this doth not at all oppoſe Mans Reſurrection out of his <hi>duſt</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>But that ſilly evaſion which is very frequent with <label type="milestone">

For if God be pleaſed to acquaint us in his word, that there ſhall be ſuch a reſurrection, and that it ſhall be then ſpiritual and incorruptible; it is our duty to take his word, and to underſtand what he is pleaſed to manifeſt to us of this great truth. Another text they frame an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection out of is 1 <hi>Cor. 19. 36, 37.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108796:126"/> though not in all circumſtances, yet that it ſhall be the ſame eſſence, is plain from the relative <hi>it</hi> all along, which hath for its antecedent the <hi>body of fleſh and blood,</hi> wherein we <hi>now</hi> live and are viſible to the bodily eyes of one another, and <hi>ver. 38. to every ſeed its own body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have met with ſome of them, who could not, or would not underſtand it of the ſame body, becauſe the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>verſ. 51. We ſhall all be changed:</hi> From whence they conclude, it cannot be the <hi>ſame</hi> body. I would ask ſuch, if they would be content to be refuſed their debt owing to them when young being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded when old; or owing when well, if demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſick; or contracted when they were not Quakers, and demanded when Quakers? for as to the latter, they will affirm they are changed, and that from natural to ſpiritual. But, I ſuppoſe, in ſuch caſes, they will ſhew more ſagacity, and be content to believe that a change <hi>in</hi> a perſon is not the change <hi>of</hi> a perſon; and for all thoſe changes, they are the ſame perſons ſtill, to whom the money both was and is due.</p>
                  <p>I might ſay moreover, that if it be another, and not the ſame body that ſhall be raiſed again, it is a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> contradiction, for then it muſt not be a reſurrection, but a creation; and who will gueſs ſo wide of the mark, that God ſhould create another body, which was never in this world, and did either good or evil, to be rewarded or puniſhed, in ſtead of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in thoſe actions, which in the mean time ſhall be free among the dead, and buried in everlaſting forgetfulneſs? Some of them have denyed the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body of Chriſt, and ſtood by their error, upon the account of his entering the room when the coors were ſhut, and his appearing in ſuch forms, that his Diſciples did not know him. To which I ſhall ſay only this, that Chriſt, as God, could convey himſelf how
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108796:126"/> and where he pleaſed, and that the Diſciples not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, was not becauſe he was not in the ſame form as before, but becauſe <hi>their eyes were withholden, that they ſhould not know him,</hi> Luk 24. 16.</p>
                  <p>The woful companions and conſequences of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Firſt, This tenet of the Quakers doth naturally eat out the heart and vitals of all Religion, if the dead riſe not, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> All Religion obliges with a reſpect to the life to come. The opinion of <hi>no reſurrection</hi> lets looſe the reins to the moſt extream ſenſuality, an Epicure is then the wiſeſt Man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this errour renders it a meer humour, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> and a peice of fooliſh obſtinacy to perſiſt in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice of any thing Religious, when indang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering our temporal concernments: <hi>If the dead riſe not at all—and why ſtand we in jeopardy every hour?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 29. 30.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it utterly ſubverts and makes Shipwrack <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> of the faith of the Goſpel, that looking at a prize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the other ſide the Grave. <hi>But if there be no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, then Chriſt is not riſen, and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith alſo in vain.</hi> 1 Cor 15, 13, 14. <hi>For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed; and if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> 1 Cor. 15, 16, 17.

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:108796:127"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then the Goſpel is a meer fallacy and <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Many more might be inferred of ſo grand an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as would render this Doctrine the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that was ever hatched among pretended Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

                  <p>We may preſume that you intend this Text to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> prove, that all Gods people are upheld, ruled, guided, <hi>&amp;c. In reference to all good by the Spirit of God;</hi> which you ſay <hi>is evidently deduceable from the words.</hi> But who would have thought that ſuch deſirable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the certain ſenſe of them, ſhould put ſo holy a man as <hi>David</hi> on ſuch expreſſions of <hi>going</hi> and <hi>flying</hi> from the Spirit and preſence of the Lord? No doubt the preſence of God is every where, in the Skies, the Seas, the Wilderneſs; what then? doth he therefore perform all theſe acts where ever he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his infinite Being, even where there are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Creatures? Doth he judge, inform, inſtruct ſtones, and trees, and mountains? I, and muſt do ſo too, or elſe he doth not anſwer the end of his preſence
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:108796:134"/> being ſo nigh? Truly Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> we have had more reverend thoughts of the Eternal and Omnipreſent God, than to aſſign any thing as the end of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But it may be you lay your ſtreſs on the certain <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> ſenſe of it; and this joyned to his Omnipreſence, will do your work. Is the ſenſe of it ſo certain to every good man? was it ſo to <hi>David</hi> when he ſo long time was tainted with a heap of impieties? Was it ſo with <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he fled (as he thought) from the preſence of the Lord? or was it ſo with you when you wrote ſome things in this book of yours which I ſhall acquaint you with before I have done. If it ſhould be granted you, that all Gods people have the certain ſenſe of it, without doubting or alteration, it would be <hi>nihil adrhombum,</hi> far from proving Gods Spirit to be the peculiar Teacher of his people, and ſo to teach them, as to render them infallible, which is the mark you aim at.</p>

To bend this Text to your bow, you talk thus; <hi>The Queſtion will be, whether it was</hi> Davids <hi>intent, and the ſcope of his deſire, that God ſhould teach, and lead him by his good Spirit, or ſome other thing? But methinks it is reſolvable in the affirmative, in two reſpects.</hi> What a ſtrange Queſtion is this! Who doubts but <hi>David</hi> commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of God as a good Teacher? what then? muſt all other Teachers, which the Spirit of God makes uſe of, as the means by which he teaches, be caſt off? Suppoſe I ſhould ſay ſuch a man is a good School-maſter, I would fain be taught by him; doth that imply I would not learn out of a Grammar, or
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:108796:135"/> other books which he uſes to that end? or, doth it not rather conclude, that I like not only his abilities, but his method and means by which he teaches? The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi> You would lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than hoot at him, that ſhould from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Pſalmiſt to reject the Spirit as a Teacher, and to admit of no other Teacher but the Law. <hi>It is after this lofty manner of diſputing you undertake our overthrow.</hi>

Why truly it is the ſafeſt courſe you take, to affirm it of both; for then the truth is owned, and (in this point) the quarrel ended. But then what need your fighting againſt what you affirm, unleſs you are reſolved to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:108796:135"/> it is within, in the memory, faith, love, and hid there with the hiding of ſecurity: but it was as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out before it was within, as the Childs Leſſon which it gets by heart out of a book; which when done, you might as well call it, the Childs <hi>Internal</hi> Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                     <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> The ſecond Propoſition I prove from <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, 29. which you cite <hi>Pag. 21. And it ſhall come to paſs afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c.

Then the Spirit of God ſhall be put within them: but this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſame without alteration. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. cited by you, Pag. 30. <hi>What? know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt did not dwell in them, according to the import of that Text, before their Converſion.</p>
                  <p>The Lord was in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and dwelt therein. <hi>I have built a Houſe of habitation for</hi>

                     <hi>cannot contain him.</hi> How did God dwell there more then elſewhere? but by placing his Name, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a relation to it as his houſe, ſanctifying it to his own uſe, manifeſting himſelf in it to thoſe who waited on his Ordinances there ſolemnized. But now the place is void of all the foot-ſteps of that preſence.</p>
                  <p>I deny not, I doubt not, but the preſence of God <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> by his Spirit in and with his people, is much more glorious than that Type poſſeſſed; yea, ſuch a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Union and Glory, as will be matter of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:108796:136"/> exerciſe, and delight for ever: yet it is moſt certainly no more his Eſſential Preſence, than is every where. The difference is his being related to, actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, effecting in, and manifeſting himſelf to, and union with the Souls of his people, ſo as none in the world but they are bleſſed withal. And herein the Saints are ſo happy, they may well be content, and not put the name of the God-head (in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe) on theſe his bleſſings. Such conceits are the natural ſource (and have been) of Opinions, and practices diſhnourable to God, and unworthy of his Grace.</p>
                  <p>Another fallacy in your arguings, is from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> teachings Indefinitely, to the Spirits teaching U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally; at leaſt all that concerns the duty of the people of God in religious things. The people of God have the Spirit; therefore they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of an unerring Spirit, in what concerned them either towards God or men.</p>
                  <p>But your main fallacies are theſe two, from an <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>infallible</hi> Spirit teaching, to the infallibility of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> in which the Spirit dwells as a Teacher; and from the Spirits <hi>teaching,</hi> to its <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>peculiar teaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, I ſhall produce ſome of your wild reaſonings. 1 Theſ. 15. 19. <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page</note>—<hi>Thoſe to whom he gave the caution had the Spirit, if thoſe could not quench the Spirit, who had it not: Conſequently the Primitive Churches were not without an unerring Spirit.</hi> But I believe, and can prove, that they who had not the Spirit themſelves, might quench it in others, by deſpiſing Prophecyings in the exerciſe of its gifts, 20. <hi>ver.</hi> and thoſe who have the motions of the Spirit (as you ſay the old
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:108796:137"/> World had before the Flood) may be far from having the Spirit in the Scripture-ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> dwelling in them to ſanctification. But ſuppoſing they had the Spirit dwelling and teaching in them, 'tis a miſerable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and weak Concluſion, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. That this is that you would conclude from ſuch improper premiſes, is apparently your drift all along.</p>
                  <p>A taſte of this you give us <hi>p.</hi> 32. in theſe words:<note place="margin">§ 2. <hi>Page 32.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>If God ſends forth his Spirit into the hearts of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then are they not without an infallible Spirit; but the expreſs Letter of the Scripture affirms it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, our Adverſaries reflection upon us, for making it part of our belief, is unſound and condemnable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Adverſaries have not ſo little knowledge of the Spirit of God, as to ſay the Spirit of God is <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible:</hi> nor yet ſo ignorant of your <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and of the Scripture, as to ſay you are <hi>infallible.</hi> If the latter be it you ſay is unfound, it is upon no other grounds, than your arguing from the infallibility of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to the infallibility of your ſpirits, or of theirs who are Gods people. But we are not ignorant that your principles make no diſtinction, much leſs a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the ſpirits of Gods people, and the Spirit of God: which is indeed the ſecret byaſs which moves you ſo obliquely; of which I ſhall give a more ample account in its place. But you are yet ſo unwilling to ſpeak plainly your mind, that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in many ſhapes to inſinuate this untruth, but are induſtrious to be uncertain and amphibious;</p>

                     <hi>a good Chriſtian, who would render Chriſt Jeſus the Head of a fallible body, by diveſting Chriſtians of an infallible Spirit, I leave to perſons of better judgment,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:108796:137"/> more honeſty, and greater moderation to judge?</hi> By this we may more than gueſs your mind: But verily, if the aſſerting Chriſt to be the Head of a fallible body, <hi>i. e.</hi> that may in ſome things erre or be miſtaken, be worthy of your ſuch reflections, I know none will eſcape them among profeſſed Chriſtians, but Quakers and Papiſts. I ſee by this you may ſerve for a Voter at <hi>Rome;</hi> but your Logick is ſo leaky, you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain a higher promotion there; ſhe will be loath to venture her Grandeur, built upon the Foundation of the Churches infallibility, upon your pitiful ſcribling.</p>
                  <p>I wonder how you came to talk of Chriſts body, to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> which he is Head: Or what men of your principles can mean by it, with the qualification of infallible? Sure you do not mean his body in the moſt ſtrict ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> the inviſible Church; that is not yet compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſting; and I doubt not, but when they meet and vote, they will be infallible: but that will not be yet. Nor yet the Univerſal Church viſible, <hi>i. e.</hi> Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, Members of the Univerſal Church, or any particular organical Church: for your party have gored, and beſmeared thoſe to exceſs. I know not how we ſhall get a vote from them, except in the Creed called the Apoſtles; to which (a ſmall matter excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) all give conſent. But then the Quakers are none of the Church, who will ſubſcribe but to few of the Articles in that Creed.</p>
                  <p>How ſhall we find your meaning? I will undertake to ſhoot near the mark, if not hit the pin in the white. You intend it of all the Quakers, and every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſon among them, at leaſt ſuch who give up to the light within, and its guidance: and is the Church in Spirit (a Phraſe uſed by Friends more than once) in their writings, but never in the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> if Chriſt be <hi>Head</hi> to none but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, wo to the poor Saints, who have truſted hitherto they had a Head in Heaven, who hath pity on the ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the way; who is their Advocate with the Father, and thereby a remedy againſt the the ſad conſequences otherwiſe of their errings. And I am ſure Chriſt is then none of your Head.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this form of your reaſoning, what <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> I ſhall ſay to it. You may as well conclude, all Gods people are omnipotent, becauſe they have the Spirit of God which is omnipotent: And they are omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, becauſe the Spirit of God who teaches them is ſo: And they are infinite upon the ſame grounds. The laſt two of theſe I can prove from ſome of the Quakers writings to be their blaſphemous Opinions, from this ground on which you build.</p>

                  <p>What would you ſay of a man that ſhould affirm his brains, heart, and lungs (being eſſential to the life of the body, and ſo interwoven, that the one goes not without the other) are but one and the ſame thing? the one cannot live, and be in good ſtate, without the other: and therefore they are but one and the ſame thing, without difference or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And the man, ſuppoſe <hi>John-a-Nokes,</hi> ſhould upon this ground, when he hath a <hi>Delirium</hi> or <hi>Vertigo</hi> (diſeaſes ſeated in the brain) be very buſie to enquire, what is good for the Pthyſick or Cough of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108796:139"/> Lungs, or palpitation of the heart? but being rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for his impertinencies, ſhould reply, they cannot be one without the other: They are eſſential to the body of man its perfection; therefore what is ſaid of the one may be ſaid of the other, and what is good againſt the Pthyſick or Cough, is good, muſt be good for a Vertigo or Delirium. Let me adviſe you next time you write, to frame no Objections againſt your ſelf; unleſs you ſhall have learned better to ſolve them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Objection you frame thus; <hi>But at this</hi>

                     <hi>rate you utterly contemn and ſeclude the Scriptures, as having no part nor portion in being a Rule, Judge, or Guide to Chriſtians.</hi> I would your whole book had conſiſted of Objections; for you have ſpoken more truth of your own framing, in two Objections, than in moſt of your affirmations. You attempt to ſolve this with much the like ſucceſs as the other; you praiſe the Scriptures, and hug them hugely, till you have reduced them to <hi>much like the ſhadow of the true Rule:</hi> And then you illuſtrate the ſenſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in theſe very words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that is ſo inward with a Prince, as to know</hi> vivâ voce, <hi>what his mind is; heeds not ſo much the ſame when he meets it in print (becauſe in print) as becauſe he hath received a more living touch, and ſenſible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Prince himſelf, to whoſe ſecrets he is privy. And this the Scriptures teach us to believe is a right Chriſtian ſtate and priviledge: For, ſaid the Apoſtle, we have the mind of Chriſt; and the ſecrets of God are with them that fear him: And guide me by thy counſel, and bring me to thy glory.</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108796:139"/> ſpoken their minds e'n as right, as if he had been inſpir'd by them all! and, no doubt, he ſhall be their White Boy, (for all his defects) who ſtrokes them ſo finely, and advances them to ſuch a ſingular Dignity of privacy and inwardneſs with God, that not only his revealed will in print is known by them in a more honourable and immediate way; but alſo his ſecrets, which never ſtooped ſo low, as to be wrapt in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>Here we have (as in a glaſs) <hi>W. P.</hi>'s. Opinion of the immediate teachings of the Spirit, to be not only above his teachings by the Scripture: as to have a thing whiſpered in the ear from the Princes own mouth, doth excel any Narrative by a Declaration: but alſo ſo much above them, that he who enjoys this favour (which muſt ſtill be no other but a Quaker) heeds not <hi>ſo much</hi> the ſame in print. How much? juſt not at all. For if this <hi>viva vox,</hi> more living touch, and ſenſible impreſſion, do not put Authority into them, they are but meer Cyphers: And if this living touch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as he believes) be without, or contrary to the Scripture, 'tis all as good and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. It is upon my Spirit, is of much more Divine Obligation, than it is written. But Mr. <hi>Pen;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>the Scriptures teach us to believe this is a right Chriſtians ſtate and priviledge,</hi> is a hard-hearted ſaying. The Scripture knows nothing of it, nor could I ever yet have a proof that any of you all ever heard the Voice of God (as <hi>vivâ voce</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood:) and I am very well ſatisfied the Quakers may be miſtaken, if they ſhould preſume they did, ever ſince ſome of them took <hi>Paul Hobſons</hi> mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling through a Trunk, and a hole in the wall, to be the voice or the Lord. But that this ſhould be the ſtate of a <hi>right</hi> Chriſtian! wo worth the days paſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108796:140"/> for ſo many Ages! wherein among all profeſſed Chriſtians, but now and then one, were in this ſtate; and that but a little while, e're their folly appeared to all men; only now and then the Papiſts had a Job to do, for which a <hi>viva vox</hi> was a fit pretence.</p>
                  <p>But you have little Charity in unchriſtianing all the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> world, whoſe very <hi>ſtate</hi> is not according to theſe Characters. A man in the dark (eſpecially if his fancy be ſtrong) is full of Viſions, which have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being than his imagination affords them: this appears to be your ſtate, and the part you are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall in ſhort conſider your warrants, which you <label type="milestone">

'Tis no matter, if it was not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> it was the Apoſtle <hi>David,</hi> and that's as good:<note place="margin">Pſa. 25. 14.</note> Nay, it is all one if it had been the Apoſtle <hi>G.

                  <p>It is further to be conſidered, that the words you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> quote out of the Scripture you pervert, and the ſenſe alſo: for <hi>ſecret,</hi> you put <hi>ſecrets:</hi> for <hi>Lord,</hi> you put <hi>God.</hi> For the latter you'l ſay it is one and the ſame

                  <p>They had an immediate Miſſion and Call from without them by Jeſus Chriſt, to preach and declare the Goſpel: That Call and Commiſſion which the Apoſtles had, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 16. to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was from without; it was Chriſt who converſed with them, and was the object of their bodily eyes: It was that Chriſt whom the women held by the feet, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and his Call (as his perſon) was without them; the ſound of which was received by their bodily ears, in thoſe words, <hi>ver. 18, 19. And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given to me in heaven, and in earth: Go ye therefore,</hi> &amp;c. And it is a ſtrong Argument to prove this immediate outward Call to be eſſential to the Apoſtolical Office and Power, that when by <hi>Judas</hi>'s fall the number was imperfect, he that was choſen in his room, was choſen and called by an outward call; the Spirit of God determining by a <hi>Lot Matthias</hi> to be the twelfth Apoſtle; as Chriſt did the reſt by his voice without them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 24. and 25 <hi>verſes:</hi> they had a large meaſure of the Spirit within, (and <hi>Matthias</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,) but that was not ſufficient.</p>

Thus we ſee that to Apoſtleſhip the ſight of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, as an outward viſible object to the bodily ſenſe, is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>A third diſtinguiſhing Character is, they were all <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> enabled to work Miracles; ſuch Miracles as were neither in ſecret for the place, nor doubtful for the matter. I ſhould but waſte time and paper to give inſtances of this; the Hiſtories of the Evangeliſts, and Acts of the Apoſtles, will furniſh you with enough. The Quakers having been conſcious of the neceſſity of this, have ſome of them pretended to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108796:147"/> Miracles to credit their Apoſtolical pretended inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; but none can they prove. Some have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſuch like performances, but have failed in the undertaking; ſo that if we will not believe them for their bold aſſerting, we are like to have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence: and he that is ſo ſilly as to believe on ſo feeble a ground, I am ſure his faith ſtands not only below the Power and Wiſdom of God, but the right reaſon of man.</p>
                  <p>And this muſt needs be a humane faith (in the moſt ſordid ſenſe) which hath not any divine evidence for its ſupport. We can by the Grace of God give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that hope in us which is grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-verity, becauſe we can prove that it is the Word of God, which was ſent from him by the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by him appointed, and furniſhed to that end; <hi>Acts 19. 13. Jeſus we know, and</hi> Paul <hi>we know; but who are ye?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles as they were commiſſionated to teach <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> all Nations, ſo they were furniſhed with Tongues and Languages in a ſupernatural way; by which they could ſpeak to the underſtandings of any Nation or people to whom they were ſent; Acts 2. 8. <hi>And how we hear every man in our own Tongue, wherein we were born.</hi> And it is remarkable, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was gifted this way above all, or moſt; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle (more eminently) to the Gentile-world, and travelled more forreign Countries than any of the other, that we read of.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but wonder at the blindneſs of the Quakers who give it as a mark to the true Miniſtry, (denying and diſdaining all others) not to be confined to a certain place in the ordinary exerciſe thereof; but as the Apoſtles, to have no leſs than the Univerſe for their Biſhoprick: while it is apparent, that they do
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:108796:147"/> not more out-ſtrip others in pretences of ſpiritual and ſupernatural gifts, than they come ſhort of them in viſible qualifications for the Miniſterial imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially the knowledge of the Tongues: and who ever among them underſtand any Tongue, or can ſpeak or write it, beſides their Native Mother-tongue; let them ſay it if they dare, that they came not by it by natural and ordinary means.</p>
                  <p>And if God had given them an Apoſtolical Call and and Gifts, ſurely this of Tongues would have made ſome ſigne and noiſe of it; for God never calleth to any Goſpel-Office and work immediate, where he doth not afford abilities for the diſcharge of it. If the Quakers had the Gift of Tongues, who direct their pamphlets to all Princes and potentates; to every Creature, and all Nations in the World; ſurely ſome of them by that Gift would have preached their Doctrines to forreign Nations: But ſome have attempted it, and ſped ſo ill, as to become dumb preachers in other Countries: Others have learned more wit than to make the adventure; their Writings are full ſtuffed with the bold aſſerting of their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Call, Gifts and Inſpiration.</p>
                  <p>Having given you ſome Characters of the Apoſtles, <label type="milestone">

So that every Babe in Chriſt hath the Spirit of Chriſt in its ſaving manifeſtations and opperations, or <hi>effects;</hi> though but a few were immediately inſpired. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly expreſs this ſpecifical <label type="milestone">

The Apoſtle doth in the caſe there agitated, give his advice as a Saint who had the Spirit of God in the ſame kind of enlightning, which other Saints had, or all the Saints had; but in an eminent meaſure: yet this enlightning and teaching of the Spirit was not by way of immediate, and Apoſtolical inſpiration; but by enlightning his judgment, and enabling his natural faculty of diſcerning to pierce into, and rightly decide the difference.</p>
                  <p>For if the Apoſtle had received what he here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Divine inſpiration, or the Spirit of the Lord immediately inſpiring, it would have been not only unneceſſary, but very much injurious to the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

So that in

                  <p>The great Objection of the Quakers againſt the <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But to put all out of doubt, the 20 <hi>verſe</hi> ſpeaks what <label type="milestone">

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:108796:149"/> againſt God the Creator, whom they might and ought to have known, and acknowledged. God is in his Eſſential Being the Inviſible God; but he was manifeſt among them, How? From the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, by the things that are made. Take another Text for the confirmation of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this, <hi>Act. 14. 17.

                  <p>Whereas that illumination of the Spirit, which (in the kind of it) is common to all Saints, flows in by the Lords bleſſing on the improvement of their underſtandings and judgments, whether on Creation, Providence, or matter divinely revealed without them originally, <hi>viz.</hi> that contained in the Scripture; which although their faith be reſolved into, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by, yet the higheſt pitch of their ſpiritual underſtanding is raiſed by a right and ſanctified ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination from thoſe principles, comparing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things with ſpiritual.

                  <p>That God doth bleſs in ſuch ways to the (ſuch) <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:108796:151"/>
                  <p>If any Quaker ſhall ſay, True, we are illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not by Study, and <hi>poring</hi> (as they call it) <hi>on the Scripture,</hi> or any thing elſe, but have our knowledge without ſuch carnal toil, and the wiſdom of the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; and therefore it is by inſpiration immediate.

                  </p>
                  <p>A third Difference is, that Apoſtolical illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and immediately inſpired, are not habitual; they are not the more conſtant frame of the ſoul, but have their fluxes, not as Springs, or running Rivers, or Tydes, which have their ebbings and flowings, yet the Chanel alway plentifully ſupplied, but as bourns and flouds that ſometimes riſe high; yet the grounds they cover for a while, are ſometimes and ordinarily a long time dry, and no appearance remaining of thoſe inundations. The Apoſtles and Prophets had not ſuch a Well and Spring of this ſort, as alway run; or out of which they might ordinarily give advice, and teachings of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Spirits moſt ordinary illuminations, common to all Saints, do in their ſeveral degrees and meaſures in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dwell in their ſouls, and are as qualities adhering to their ſubjects; their minds and faculties being ſo united to them, as Sugar being melted in the Wine, its ſweetneſs is conſtant, and abiding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>And hence it was that the Apoſtles, though they could alway teach from the habits of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they were bleſſed with, yet in ſome caſes, at ſome times, could not ſpeak as inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, witneſs <hi>Paul,</hi> who in the body of his Epiſtle

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Apoſtle gives inſtruction concerning the Choice of Biſhops, that they be ſuch as are <hi>apt to teach;</hi>

                  <p>A fourth Difference, the inſpiration of the Spirit <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, All the Prophets have a Teſtimony of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:108796:153"/> their being inſpired of God, by Miracles which they wrought, or by the quoting Scripture out of the Books written by them, or bearing their names (in the New Teſtament) by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, All thoſe Books of the Old Teſtament, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The ſecond thing I muſt reply to is, what the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>6</label> frequently object, <hi>viz.</hi> That we make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Judge of the Spirit, whereas the Spirit gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this is for want of judgment in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors. Far be it from us to bring the to-be-adored Spirit of God to any mans Bar for judgment to be paſſed on it, or any thing that is his immediate work or word: All we profeſs in this matter, to make the Scripture a Judge or Determiner of, is, whether this or that be the mind of the Spirit or no? but if once it appear to be the voice and mind of the Spirit, we profeſs it our duty to reverence and ſubmit to it. And we being certain that the holy Scriptures were given forth from God, and that God is not oppoſite to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; we conclude, that what is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be the Word of the Spirit; becauſe then the Spirit ſhould bear witneſs againſt it ſelf, and the word of the Spirit would be contrary to the word of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, if any ſhall pretend to aboliſh (by <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>7</label> the Authority or inſpiration of the Spirit) thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Inſtitutions which were ſetled by Chriſt, or Chriſt in his Apoſtles; it would be unreaſonable to credit them, without the ſame Teſtimonials (ſuch Miracles as they wrought) by which they were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Quakers are far enough from ſhewing ſuch a zeal for their pretended Miniſtry and Order. And further, we are obliged not to receive another Goſpel (and that by the Holy Spirit) though an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven ſhould preach it: and we are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to believe any other as Truth Divine againſt it, though many wonders ſhould be wrought for confirmation.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:108796:154"/>
                  <p>The third thing I muſt reply to is, that our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>8</label> of the mind of God by the Scriptures, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I anſwer: If you mean a knowledge of all Gods mind, you are not to expect it; if you mean all that is there contained, it is not neceſſary; and you may go to Heaven, and do your duty, without ſuch a vaſt knowledge; and if you endeavour it in your places, and as God hath given you the means, it will not be your ſin, much leſs your condemnation, that you do not know it all. Sure there are many Babes in Chriſts Family, yet they are Children, and all are firſt Babes: and that would be a Monſter never yet ſeen in the Church of Chriſt, a new-born Babe knowing the mind of God contained in the Scripture, as fully as the moſt ſerious Chriſtians of the longeſt ſtanding! Jeſus Chriſt himſelf grew in wiſdom, and in ſtature: and I intreat you be content to leave a little of the mind of God to be found out in the Scripture by the Generations to come.</p>
                  <p>If you mean our knowledg of the mind of the Spirit is uncertain, ſo far as it is neceſſary for our living in an acceptable m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nner to God, ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, and to attain Heaven at laſt, it is a great miſtake: for if pride, luſt, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtand not in our way, there is no perſon (that hath a few grains of reaſon) but may underſtand ſo much of the mind of God by the Scripture, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to know to his Eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But if you talk of the Scriptures being a dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>9</label> and not moving, and teaching with a voice, or impulſe, without our reading, praying, and applying it in the Lords ſtrength, you talk at a ſtrange ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as if God had given us our eyes and brams on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look after the world, and the things thereof; but in the knowledge of God we muſt be meerly paſſive.</p>

               <p>THere is not any thing in the Quakers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of delu ding, which doth more tend to the inſnaring of unwary Souls, than their aſſerting their Falſe, Antichriſtian, and Anti-Scriptural Tenets, under Scripture-words and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in thoſe very terms wherein are expreſſed the Truths of God; while in the mean time, they mean nothing leſs than their true import, and what people (who are not well acquainted with their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets) ſuppoſe them to mean.

            <p>The firſt and <hi>chief Principle</hi> which the Quakers cried up, and endeavoured to <hi>obtrude</hi> on all they attempted to <hi>draw off</hi> from the <hi>common</hi> Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and to <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſelyte</hi> to themſelves; was, That <hi>every</hi> man hath a light <hi>in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108796:171"/> him,</hi> which is no leſs than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit, Chriſt the Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. and that this Light is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to lead into the knowledge of <hi>all</hi> Truth, and to move men by its <hi>Power,</hi> to the <hi>compleat</hi> and perfect <hi>Obedience.</hi> And as upon this Principle, they did, and do diſcard the Scriptures from being a <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Life, and from bearing the <hi>name</hi> of the Word of God: So, many of them believed it as ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed, That all <hi>their</hi> Miniſtry and ordered Meetings, to declare what they called their Teſtimony, was not only <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,</hi> but alſo a contradiction to their main Principle (which is indeed rightly inferred.) Another Principle grounded on the former Foundation was, To exclude all <hi>Forms</hi> of Worſhip, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and every one to be left to his <hi>own proper</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to meet, or not to meet; to ſpeak, or be ſilent; as he or ſhe ſhould be guided by his or her <hi>private</hi> Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the practices which ſuited to this Principle, as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred its Profeſſors diſcordant and contrary to each other, and ridiculous to Obſervers: So alſo it deprived their Heads and Leaders of that <hi>Denomination,</hi> which was as ambitiouſly ſought by them, as by any <hi>Sect-Maſters</hi> heretofore.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>theſe</hi> Conſiderations, thoſe who were chief in eſteem and intereſt among them, began to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the reſt, what they <hi>pretended</hi> was by the Spirit dictated to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it did not meet with the ſame <hi>inward reliſhes</hi> and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the reſt. Many of the Quakers (who kept to their firſt Principle) were hereat greatly offended, and made oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt thoſe Obtruſions as Tyrannical, and ſubverting their Foundation. One of whom was the Author of that large Letter of Complaint, publiſhed in a little Piece, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>THE SPIRIT OF THE HAT:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Muclow</note> In which may be ſeen the main Grounds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Ruling and Non-Conforming Quakers, and as well penn'd as was ever any thing by a Quaker.</p>
            <p>But to reconcile theſe Impoſitions, with the Principle of the Sufficiency and Divinity of the Light within every man, the Impoſers <hi>pretend,</hi> That the Light of the Body (<hi>i e.</hi> Such who bear the ſway) can taſte and diſcern what is from the <hi>true</hi> Light in any; and therefore what anſwers not to that Diſcerning-Spirit in the Body, is to be exploded, as not from the true Principle.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Teſtimony (alias,</hi> The Quakers <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi>) I ſhall remark theſe following particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108796:172"/>1. That in the Title, it is ordered to be <hi>read</hi> in all their Meetings, and <hi>kept</hi> by them as a <hi>Teſtimony:</hi> Which are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> obtain not with <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Subſcribers, and thoſe others who joyned with them in their <hi>Convocations,</hi> pretend to have <hi>met</hi> by the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit;</hi> and to have had in that Negotiation, the <hi>preſence of the Lord with them,</hi> and that hereupon they ground the following Dictates and Impoſitions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That although they take it ſo <hi>grievouſly,</hi> that they ſhould be accounted no Chriſtians by us; yet they own no other to be the Church of Chriſt but themſelves, and have the Charity to reckon of all others as <hi>Without,</hi> and as <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi> among which ſort they are to be numbered whom <hi>they</hi> Excommunicate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That notwithſtanding their former <hi>decrying</hi> a ſtated and ordained Miniſtry, Rule and Dignities in the Church, as <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical and Antichriſtian;</hi> they have now a Miniſtry, Rulers, Dignities, Offices, and Dominions erected among <hi>themſelves,</hi> as neceſſary to the ſubſiſting of <hi>their</hi> Fellowſhip: And affirm, That it is <hi>abominable Pride for</hi> any <hi>particular,</hi> not to ſubmit to the judgment given by them, called, The judgment of the Body.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That although they have (with their Authors the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and Jeſuites) reproached the holy Scriptures, as a <hi>lame and inſufficient</hi> Rule; yea, as <hi>no</hi> Rule: Countenancing this their <hi>Diſtraction</hi> from the <hi>diverſities</hi> of Opinions, Parties, and Factions which are found among thoſe who <hi>own</hi> it for <hi>their</hi> Rule; yet they themſelves (for all the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> of their Light <hi>within</hi>) have Doubts, Diſcords, and Factions among themſelves, and each pretending the <hi>Light</hi> for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: So that their pretended Remedy, is an early breeder of thoſe Diſeaſes, for which they boaſted of it as an <hi>Infallible Cure.</hi>

            <p>It was a cunning Artifice of Satan, in his firſt Attempts by by his Quaking Inſtruments; to draw them off from the Yoke of Chriſt in his Word and Ordinances; by aſſerting, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man had a ſufficient Light and Motion within <hi>himſelf,</hi> which if heeded, would be more effectual to render them perfect, than all the Precepts and Rules in the Bible; by which, Pride, Idleneſs, and Libertiniſm is exceedingly gratified.

I ſhall now add ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable parts of their <hi>Diſcipline, Order,</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> wherein they ſymbolize with <hi>Rome, no leſs</hi> than in the former.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do the Papiſts pretend themſelves to be the <hi>only Church,</hi> and all other Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick? The Quakers call themſelves <hi>only</hi> the Body, the Church of Chriſt, and all others Antichriſtian, Heathen and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do the Papiſts by their little Juncto's, which they call <hi>General Councils,</hi> make Laws, Canons and Conſtitutions, beſide and contrary to the Scriptures, and impoſe them on their Members, as of Divine Authority? So do the Quakers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do the Papiſts admit none into <hi>their Councils,</hi> but ſuch as are in Unity with their Church, and acknowledg the Pope the Roman Head? Neither will the Quakers admit any (though <hi>profeſſed</hi> Quakers) into their Councils, or to order any thing in their Church-affairs, who are <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>Ruling</hi> party, are not in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> or that comply not with <hi>George Fox</hi> the Quakers Pope.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do the Popiſh Councils (with, or without the Pope) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>preſent</hi> with them, and its <hi>Authority</hi> for all their Determinations to be <hi>Infallible?</hi> Wherein do the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers differ from the ſame <hi>Arrogancy?</hi> when they affirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>meet by the Operation of the Spirit of Truth;</hi> That the <hi>preſence</hi> of the Lord is with them in their Conful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and then teſtifie and impoſe them <hi>in the name of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Do the Romiſts call the Pope, or the Pope with his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle</hi> of the Prelates, the <hi>Church,</hi> and impoſe their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Determinations as the mind and Laws of the <hi>Church?</hi> The Quakers are herein not a hairs-breadth differing from them. For that which they call the <hi>Light and Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and its Determinations is no other than the <hi>Dictates</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Leading</hi> Quakers;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108796:174"/> which yet are impoſed on the reſt of the Quakers, as the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> or of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do the Papiſts obtrude a ſubmiſſion of the private Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Opinions of any of their Members, to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Pope, or Pope and Council? So do the Quakers; requiring, That no mans <hi>particular</hi> Opinion do lift up it ſelf againſt the Light of the <hi>Body;</hi> but be determined thereby, and <hi>acquieſce</hi> therein.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Do the Papiſts reject the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from being their <hi>Rule,</hi> while they advance <hi>Traditions</hi> in their rooms? The Quakers have gone <hi>beyond</hi> them, who give not that Authority to the Scriptures which the Papiſts allow them; and to <hi>over-match</hi> the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Traditions, bring in the Doctrine of <hi>Good ancient Friends</hi> as their Rule, while the Scriptures are denied <hi>that</hi> Preferment.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For <hi>Implicite Faith,</hi> the Quakers are no way inferiour to the moſt ſtrict Votaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> The pretended Light and Inſpiration of their Leaders, they have a <hi>ſwallow</hi> for, that a Monſter as big as a Whale will paſs without haeſitation. And that theſe pretended Inſpirations are <hi>indeed</hi> from the Spirit of God, they have no other proof, but the <hi>Opinion</hi> of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> or the <hi>Miracles in Spirit</hi> which <hi>George Fox</hi> talks of; which are as indemonſtrable as the other.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The continual Sacrifice of Chriſt in the Popiſh Maſs, hath a good Preparative in that Principle of the Quakers, <hi>That Chriſt</hi> in <hi>them</hi> doth <hi>offer up himſelf a living Sacrifice to God for them; by which the wrath of God is appeaſed towards them.</hi> 'Tis but removing the inviſible Sacrifice from the dark and cloſe corner within, to the Altar in ſome viſible ſign, 'tis all one: Which may <hi>in time</hi> appear as <hi>agreeing</hi> to the light, as <hi>W. Penn's</hi> Ceremony of keeping the Hat <hi>off</hi> in Prayer, doth fitly ſignifie the <hi>Veil removed</hi> from their hearts.</p>
            <p>It would yet ſeem a <hi>lame</hi> Compariſon between the Papiſts and Quakers, if among the Quakers there be no <hi>Idols,</hi> nor yet the Image of the Pope, the greateſt Idol of all the reſt. But the Jeſuites and Factors of <hi>Rome</hi> have not been ſuch unskilful Artiſts, and unfaithful Servants to <hi>their</hi> Maſter, as to do their work ſo <hi>imperfectly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. If the Light <hi>within</hi> be not God (as certainly it is not) then do they <hi>profeſſedly</hi> give Divine Worſhip to a <hi>Creature,</hi> or to an <hi>Imagination</hi> of their own framing. And if the Souls and Spirits of men are God, or a part of God, and of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by <hi>their Principles</hi> (which are as truly their Principles as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108796:174"/> words can expreſs) then they are <hi>Idolaters</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But the Romiſts give Divine Worſhip to <hi>Saints,</hi> which is not (as moſt believe) the Quakers Idolatry. If I do not prove them herein to <hi>overmatch</hi> them, I am greatly miſtaken; and whether I am or not, I will leave it to my Readers judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Quakers Worſhip (as they profeſs) is <hi>inward</hi> Worſhip, which all confeſs to be the moſt <hi>excellent</hi> part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And therefore if they affirm Worſhip to be given to thoſe whom they put in the room of Saints, it muſt be acknowledged that they worſhip them, though their bodies bow not down to them.</p>
            <p>They profeſs to worſhip thoſe <hi>who are ſprung from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gentle Seed,</hi> and that with <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, and to <hi>bow down to the loweſt appearances of Chriſts Light and Spirit.</hi> Yea, <hi>George Fox</hi> tells us, That <hi>not to worſhip Chriſt in them, is to worſhip Men, Devils, or Angels.</hi> This kind of Idolatry may explain the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the Quakers looking ſo devoutly for a conſiderable ſeaſon in each others <hi>faces</hi> when they meet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing all the while in a <hi>deep</hi> ſilence.</p>
            <p>And there are ſufficient witneſſes (living) of the <hi>bodily and viſible</hi> Worſhip, which <hi>James Naylor</hi> received from divers of them. Herein they exceed the Papiſts Idolatry, in the <hi>number</hi> of their Idols; being all that have Chriſt in them, or that are <hi>ſprung from the noble, gentle Seed,</hi> viz. All thorow Quakers: And in the <hi>quality</hi> of their Idol-Saints; for in the room of S. <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> the Virgin Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are <hi>William, George,</hi> &amp;c. who are as like to thoſe Saints, as the blacker ſort of white Devils: And alſo in point of <hi>Time;</hi> for the Papiſts worſhip <hi>their</hi> Saints after their death, but the Quakers worſhip <hi>theirs</hi> while living. See <hi>Quakeriſm no Chriſtianity,</hi> Chap. 16. for a fuller proof of this.</p>
            <p n="12">12. To find a Pope, or ſomewhat <hi>like</hi> him among the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, we need ſeek no further than <hi>George Fox;</hi> who is among <hi>them</hi> a Pope, and more than a Pope.

            <p>Doth the Pope pretend to be Chriſts <hi>Vicar,</hi> and clothed with <hi>his</hi> power? So is it pretended of <hi>George,</hi> that his <hi>Habitation is in the</hi> power <hi>of the Higheſt.</hi>

In other paſſages of this Letter, <hi>that</hi> is imputed to <hi>George Fox,</hi> which the Pope never dared yet to aſſume to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And in this Letter, we have a Sentence <hi>explained,</hi> which is the cloſe of the Preamble in the <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> wherein 'tis ſaid, that ſuch who perſiſt in their diſſent from the Body, muſt be <hi>kept under with the power of God, till they come into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Witneſs of God, of the encreaſe of whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>By this you may be ſatisfied of the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power of <hi>G: Fox,</hi> the Quakers <hi>Infallible</hi> Pope, and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of his Dominion over the Quakers; who according to <hi>their</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are the only Chriſtians, and Church of Chriſt; all others being accounted by <hi>them</hi> the <hi>World, Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> And it would amaze a ſerious and intelligent perſon, to hear of the <hi>ſtrange Reverence</hi> and Submiſſion given to this <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> by the Quakers in <hi>England, Ireland, Holland, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bado's, Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, and other parts where <hi>this Deluſion</hi> hath gotten footing: Of which he made proof in his Travels the laſt year, to viſit his Subjects in all the aforeſaid parts, or moſt of them.</p>
            <p>Take only two Inſtances more of this Quaker-Pope. The firſt was a ſaying of <hi>his</hi> to ſome of the <hi>Friends;</hi> viz. <hi>Friends, Although I have not told it you, I now declare it, I HAVE POWER TO BIND, AND TO LOOSE WHOM I PLEASE.</hi> This was charged upon him in the Letter print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called, <hi>The Spirit of the Hat,</hi> and in the Quakers Reply was not denied.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inſtance is, of a blaſphemous Paſſage of a grand Quaker (<hi>Solomon Eccles</hi>) in his Book, entituled, <hi>The Quakers Challenge: It was ſaid of Christ, that he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not: So it may be ſaid of this true Prophet, whom</hi> John <hi>ſaid he was not.</hi> This man was <hi>Foxes</hi> great Favourite.</p>
            <p>From theſe and <hi>ſuch-like</hi> Conſiderations, many of the Quakers <hi>themſelves</hi> cry out upon the <hi>Foxonian</hi> and prevailing party. <hi>They are like</hi> Rome, and their management of matters in <hi>their</hi> Church, is <hi>Popery, Tyranny, Lording, Arbitrary:</hi> which Complaints are confeſſed by the Authors of, <hi>The Spirit of</hi> Alexander, to be the <hi>Out-cry</hi> of many of the Quakers, who for their <hi>ſenſibleneſs</hi> of this unexpected <hi>Roman-like Form of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> are as <hi>doggedly</hi> rated in that Book, as ever <hi>Hereticks</hi> were by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Popery never aroſe to ſuch a perfection in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a time, among any people in the World, whoſe <hi>firſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were ſuch <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>oppoſites</hi> to it. And if it be juſtly ſaid of the Pope, or <hi>Papal</hi> Body, That he hath a mouth ſpeaking <hi>Blaſphemies;</hi> it will be no crime to impute the ſame to <hi>George Fox</hi> and his Adherents.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>ſad</hi> Conſideration, That the Quakers ſhould be ſo <hi>infatuated</hi> by their <hi>firſt</hi> opinions of their <hi>Leaders</hi> teaching from the <hi>immediate</hi> Inſpiration of the Spirit of God, and of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108796:176"/> their <hi>Infallibility</hi> (the reſult of the other) as not to be able, or <hi>willing</hi> to diſcern their ſo <hi>notorious an Impoſture;</hi> Which (if there were no other Demonſtration) their Non-ſenſe, <hi>Self</hi>-Contradiction, ſetting up the things they <hi>once</hi> deſtroyed, and nulling (in effect) that <hi>particular</hi> light of <hi>every</hi> man, which they once <hi>Deified,</hi> diſcover with <hi>Sun-beams.</hi> But what is the ſin of many beſides them (though not in ſo <hi>high</hi> a degree) is <hi>their</hi> ſin and ſnare. They had rather go forward <hi>out</hi> of the way, than by <hi>returning</hi> to thoſe Principles from whence they are faln, to <hi>confeſs</hi> themſelves Tranſgreſſors; which is from a ſpirit of Pride and Folly. And indeed, conſidering what <hi>height</hi> of Pride, and <hi>depth</hi> of Errour, Folly and Ignorance, with contempt of their Betters, do meet together in theſe Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Deluſion, I wonder not that, <hi>AS PRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D AS A Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKER,</hi> is become <hi>proverbial</hi> I pray God deliver them from that eternal and inevitable deſtruction, of which their obſtinacy is a ſad Omen. <hi>I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go,</hi> is two exactly the ſpirit they are of.</p>
            <p>The foregoing things conſidered, it is not difficult to find ſuch a preparedneſs for <hi>down-right Popery,</hi> in the <hi>preſent</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Quakers Religion, as may render it no <hi>great ſtrain</hi> to jump into it, when-ever they find it their intereſt. For why ſhould it be thought <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> that they ſhould rather chooſe to ſubmit their <hi>particular</hi> Sentiments to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of a Pope and Council, who pretend to the <hi>Spirits</hi> guidance infallibly <hi>therein,</hi> than to the Determinations of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and his <hi>ſilly</hi> Adherents, called the <hi>Body,</hi> who can give no better aſſurance of their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> (or common <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> either) than <hi>mere pretences,</hi> mounted on confident Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Arrogancy? Eſpecially conſidering, that ſuch a change will better bear the fine affected Myſtery of <hi>being felt in a meaſure of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit;</hi> which ſeems to be <hi>no other</hi> than the ſo-much <hi>vaunted</hi> Univerſality of <hi>Rome,</hi> caſt in the <hi>Canting</hi> Mould of the Quakers Phraſeology.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they will then have the Acceſſion of the numerous Auxiliaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> not needing to be ſo ſtraitned, and put to their ſhifts <hi>as now,</hi> by laying the weight of their yet <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Cauſe on ſo many Equivocations, and <hi>thin</hi> Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges, defended by only two or three unskilful and unwary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. And what if they ſhall think meet to embrace the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> inſtead of <hi>THE DOCTRINES OF GOOD ANCIENT FRIENDS?</hi> I am ſure it would be ſhort of a <hi>Miracle.</hi> And the things being the ſame in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108796:177"/> why ſhould a mere <hi>verbal</hi> difference be a Gulph <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I deſire the Quakers to be but ſo juſt to <hi>themſelves,</hi> as to conſider whether what hath been ſaid, do not <hi>at leaſt</hi> call them to a ſuſpicion, that their Leaders are rowing towards <hi>Tybur,</hi> whatever face they put upon it: And what an <hi>exchange</hi> they have made, in rejecting the Scriptures from being their <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp; taking at length the <hi>Impoſitions of men</hi> in its room; which are ſo much the more wicked and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as they <hi>lay them</hi> to the Spirit of God as their <hi>Father;</hi> and ſo much the more <hi>dangerous,</hi> as the Opinion theſe men have obtained among them, will render it neither pleaſant nor credible, for them <hi>now</hi> to queſtion any thing they <hi>ſay,</hi> or reject any thing they <hi>impoſe.</hi>

                  <p>That all that pretend to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, and have a Call from <hi>Men,</hi> are not the Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>their</hi> Miniſtry teach <hi>only</hi> from the <hi>immediate</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Inſpiration of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>their</hi> Miniſters are <hi>infallible</hi> in their miniſtring.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>our</hi> Miniſters, who receive Maintenance for their work, are <hi>Hirelings, Thieves, and Robbers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That thoſe who preach from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> taking their Sermons from thence, <hi>ſteal</hi> the Prophets words, and are <hi>not</hi> ſent of God.</p>
                  <p>That men are to preach nothing, but what they have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to from the Spirit at <hi>that</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>That thoſe who preach Chriſt <hi>without,</hi> are <hi>falſe</hi> Miniſters; and thoſe are <hi>true</hi> Miniſters, who preach Chriſt <hi>within,</hi> and put people upon believing on him, as he is manifeſted <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>end</hi> of all their Teaching is, to bring men to the Everlaſting Word of God in themſelves; i. e. <hi>To follow the Light within.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That whatever their Miniſters teach, it is not <hi>they</hi> that <hi>teach,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit through them.</hi>

                  <p>They hold (<hi>ſome of them,</hi>) That there ought to be no ſuch thing as Elders and Overſeers in the Church, but that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>alone</hi> is Apoſtle, Prophet, Elder, Overſeer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the firſt and general Opinion: But ſince they have ſo far changed their minds (the moſt of them) as to hold <hi>Dignities, Offices, Government</hi> neceſſary; and alſo, That it is not the <hi>Officers,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit in</hi> the Officers, that doth all the parts belonging to their Offices.</p>

                  <p>All theſe things they hold to be <hi>within,</hi> in the time of <hi>this</hi> life.

                  <p>The Reſurrection of this body wherein the ſoul now lives, they peremptorily deny, affirming; The belief that ever it ſhall be quickned and made alive again, to be ridiculous and irrational.</p>
                  <p>They profeſs Eternal Rewards; but it amounts <hi>only</hi> to this conceit, That the body ſhall not live again after its death, and ſo there is no reward to that. And the ſoul they ſay is <hi>Eternal,</hi> came <hi>out</hi> from God, is a part of his <hi>Being,</hi> ſhall return into him again: So that the ſoul ſhall be changed from a part of God dwelling in fleſh, to a part of God reſolved into his own and original Being; which was the ſtate of their ſouls a thouſand years <hi>afore</hi> they were born (as they conceit.) Thus God alone ſhall be Eternally rewarded, by being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of theſe Priſons of the Quakers bodies.</p>
